# i3ipc-lua

An improved Lua library to control [i3wm](http://i3wm.org).

## About

i3's interprocess communication (or [ipc](http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html)) is the interface i3wm uses to receive [commands](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_list_of_commands) from client applications such as `i3-msg`. It also features a publish/subscribe mechanism for notifying interested parties of window manager events.

i3ipc-lua is a Lua library for controlling the window manager. This project is intended to be useful for general scripting, and for applications that interact with the window manager like status line generators, notification daemons, and pagers.

## Documentation

The latest documentation can be found [here](http://dubstepdish.com/i3ipc-glib). i3ipc-lua is a [GObject introspection](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/) library (kind of like [gtk](https://developer.gnome.org/)).

## Installation

i3ipc-lua requires [i3ipc-GLib](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-glib) and [lua-lgi](https://github.com/pavouk/lgi).

Then simply do:

```shell
./autogen.sh
sudo make install
```

Or get someone to host a package for your distro.

## Example

```lua
#!/usr/bin/env lua

local i3ipc = require 'i3ipc'

-- Create the Connection object that can be used to send commands and subscribe
-- to events.
local conn = i3ipc.Connection()

-- Query the ipc for outputs. The result is a list that represents the parsed
-- reply of a command like `i3-msg -t get_outputs`.
local outputs = conn:get_outputs()

print('Active outputs:')

for _,o in ipairs(outputs) do
    if o.active then
        print(o.name)
    end
end

-- Send a command to be executed synchronously.
conn:command('focus left')

-- Define a callback to be called when you switch workspaces.
function on_workspace(self, e)
    -- The first parameter is the connection to the ipc and the second is an object
    -- with the data of the event sent from i3.
    if e.current then
        print('Windows on this workspace:')
        for _,w in ipairs(e.current:descendents()) do
            print(w.name)
        end
    end
end

-- Subscribe to the workspace event
conn:on('workspace', on_workspace)

-- Start the main loop and wait for events to come in.
conn:main()
```

## Contributing

We should do what we can to make this library as Lua-like as good tastes allows. New features should be implemented on the main project at [i3ipc-GLib](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-glib).
